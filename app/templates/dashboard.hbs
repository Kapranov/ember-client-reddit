  A man fired a rifle on Sunday inside a Washington pizza restaurant
  that has been subjected to harassment based on false stories tying
  it to child abuse, the police said. No one was hurt, and the man was
  arrested. The man, Edgar M. Welch, 28, of Salisbury, N.C., told
  the police that he had come to the restaurant, Comet Ping Pong, in
  northwest Washington, to “self-investigate” what is being called
  Pizzagate, an online conspiracy theory asserting, with no evidence,
  that the restaurant is somehow tied to a child abuse ring.
  He entered the restaurant shortly before 3 p.m. with a rifle and
  fired it at least once inside, the police said.
