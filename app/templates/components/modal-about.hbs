  The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe won a major victory on Sunday
  in its battle to block an oil pipeline being built near its
  reservation when the Department of the Army announced that
  it would not allow the pipeline to be drilled under a dammed
  section of the Missouri River.
  The Army said it would look for alternative routes for the $3.7
  billion Dakota Access pipeline. Construction of the route
  a half-mile from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation has
  become a global flash point for environmental and indigenous
  activism, drawing thousands of people out here to a sprawling
  prairie camp of tents, tepees and yurts.
